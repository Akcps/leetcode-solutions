### 280. Wiggle Sort

https://leetcode.com/problems/wiggle-sort/

Given an integer array nums, reorder it such that nums[0] <= nums[1] >= nums[2] <= nums[3]....

You may assume the input array always has a valid answer.



Example 1:

    Input: nums = [3,5,2,1,6,4]
    Output: [3,5,1,6,2,4]
    Explanation: [1,6,2,5,3,4] is also accepted.
Example 2:

    Input: nums = [6,6,5,6,3,8]
    Output: [6,6,5,6,3,8]


Constraints:

    1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 104
    0 <= nums[i] <= 104
    It is guaranteed that there will be an answer for the given input nums.
