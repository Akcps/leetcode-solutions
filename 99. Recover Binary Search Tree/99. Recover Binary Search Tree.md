### 99. Recover Binary Search Tree

https://leetcode.com/problems/recover-binary-search-tree/

You are given the root of a binary search tree (BST), where exactly two nodes of the tree were swapped by mistake. Recover the tree without changing its structure.

Follow up: A solution using O(n) space is pretty straight forward. Could you devise a constant space solution?



Example 1:

    https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/28/recover1.jpg
    
    Input: root = [1,3,null,null,2]
    Output: [3,1,null,null,2]
    Explanation: 3 cannot be a left child of 1 because 3 > 1. Swapping 1 and 3 makes the BST valid.
Example 2:


    Input: root = [3,1,4,null,null,2]
    Output: [2,1,4,null,null,3]
    Explanation: 2 cannot be in the right subtree of 3 because 2 < 3. Swapping 2 and 3 makes the BST valid.


Constraints:

    The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 1000].
    -231 <= Node.val <= 231 - 1
