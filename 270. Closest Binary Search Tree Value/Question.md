**270. Closest Binary Search Tree Value**

https://leetcode.com/problems/closest-binary-search-tree-value/

**Given a non-empty binary search tree and a target value, find the value in the BST that is closest to the target.**

Note:

Given target value is a floating point.
You are guaranteed to have only one unique value in the BST that is closest to the target.

Example:

    Input: root = [4,2,5,1,3], target = 3.714286
    
        4
       / \
      2   5
     / \
    1   3
    
    Output: 4
