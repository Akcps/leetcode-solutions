https://leetcode.com/problems/paint-house-ii/


There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the k colors. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a n x k cost matrix. For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with color 0; costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with color 2, and so on... Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.

Note:
All costs are positive integers.

Example:

    Input: [[1,5,3],[2,9,4]]
    Output: 5
    Explanation: Paint house 0 into color 0, paint house 1 into color 2. Minimum cost: 1 + 4 = 5; 
                 Or paint house 0 into color 2, paint house 1 into color 0. Minimum cost: 3 + 2 = 5.
