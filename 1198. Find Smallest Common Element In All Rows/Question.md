https://leetcode.com/problems/find-smallest-common-element-in-all-rows/

**Given a matrix mat where every row is sorted in increasing order, return the smallest common element in all rows.**

If there is no common element, return -1.



**Example 1:**

Input: mat = [[1,2,3,4,5],[2,4,5,8,10],[3,5,7,9,11],[1,3,5,7,9]]

Output: 5
 

**Constraints:**

- 1 <= mat.length, mat[i].length <= 500

- 1 <= mat[i][j] <= 10^4

- mat[i] is sorted in increasing order.
