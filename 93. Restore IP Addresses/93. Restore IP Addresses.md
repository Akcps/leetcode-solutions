### 93. Restore IP Addresses

https://leetcode.com/problems/restore-ip-addresses/

Given a string s containing only digits, return all possible valid IP addresses that can be obtained from s. You can return them in any order.

A valid IP address consists of exactly four integers, each integer is between 0 and 255, separated by single dots and cannot have leading zeros. For example, "0.1.2.201" and "192.168.1.1" are valid IP addresses and "0.011.255.245", "192.168.1.312" and "192.168@1.1" are invalid IP addresses.



Example 1:

    Input: s = "25525511135"
    Output: ["255.255.11.135","255.255.111.35"]
Example 2:

    Input: s = "0000"
    Output: ["0.0.0.0"]
Example 3:

    Input: s = "1111"
    Output: ["1.1.1.1"]
Example 4:

    Input: s = "010010"
    Output: ["0.10.0.10","0.100.1.0"]
Example 5:

    Input: s = "101023"
    Output: ["1.0.10.23","1.0.102.3","10.1.0.23","10.10.2.3","101.0.2.3"]


Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 3000
s consists of digits only.
