**333. Largest BST Subtree**

https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-bst-subtree/

Given a binary tree, find the largest subtree which is a Binary Search Tree (BST), where largest means subtree with largest number of nodes in it.

Note:
A subtree must include all of its descendants.

Example:

    Input: [10,5,15,1,8,null,7]
    
       10 
       / \ 
      5  15 
     / \   \ 
    1   8   7
    
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The Largest BST Subtree in this case is the highlighted one.
                 The return value is the subtree's size, which is 3.
