### 255. Verify Preorder Sequence in Binary Search Tree

https://leetcode.com/problems/verify-preorder-sequence-in-binary-search-tree/

Given an array of unique integers preorder, return true if it is the correct preorder traversal sequence of a binary search tree.


Example 1:

    Input: preorder = [5,2,1,3,6]
    Output: true
Example 2:

    Input: preorder = [5,2,6,1,3]
    Output: false


Constraints:

    1 <= preorder.length <= 104
    1 <= preorder[i] <= 104
    All the elements of preorder are unique.
