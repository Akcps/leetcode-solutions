**1060. Missing Element in Sorted Array**

https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-element-in-sorted-array/

Given a sorted array A of unique numbers, find the K-th missing number starting from the leftmost number of the array.

 

Example 1:

    Input: A = [4,7,9,10], K = 1
    Output: 5
    Explanation: 
    The first missing number is 5.
Example 2:

    Input: A = [4,7,9,10], K = 3
    Output: 8
    Explanation: 
    The missing numbers are [5,6,8,...], hence the third missing number is 8.
Example 3:

    Input: A = [1,2,4], K = 3
    Output: 6
    Explanation: 
    The missing numbers are [3,5,6,7,...], hence the third missing number is 6.
 

Note:

- 1 <= A.length <= 50000
- 1 <= A[i] <= 1e7
- 1 <= K <= 1e8
