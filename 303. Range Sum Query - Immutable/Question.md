**303. Range Sum Query - Immutable**

https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-query-immutable/

Given an integer array nums, find the sum of the elements between indices i and j (i â‰¤ j), inclusive.

Example:

    Given nums = [-2, 0, 3, -5, 2, -1]
    
    sumRange(0, 2) -> 1
    sumRange(2, 5) -> -1
    sumRange(0, 5) -> -3
Note:
- You may assume that the array does not change.
- There are many calls to sumRange function.
