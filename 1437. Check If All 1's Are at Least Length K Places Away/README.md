**1437. Check If All 1's Are at Least Length K Places Away**

https://leetcode.com/contest/weekly-contest-187/problems/check-if-all-1s-are-at-least-length-k-places-away/


Given an array nums of 0s and 1s and an integer k, return True if all 1's are at least k places away from each other, otherwise return False.

 

Example 1:



    Input: nums = [1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1], k = 2
    Output: true
    Explanation: Each of the 1s are at least 2 places away from each other.
Example 2:



    Input: nums = [1,0,0,1,0,1], k = 2
    Output: false
    Explanation: The second 1 and third 1 are only one apart from each other.
Example 3:

    Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1], k = 0
    Output: true
Example 4:

    Input: nums = [0,1,0,1], k = 1
    Output: true
 

Constraints:

    1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
    0 <= k <= nums.length
    nums[i] is 0 or 1
