**366. Find Leaves of Binary Tree**

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-leaves-of-binary-tree/

**Given a binary tree, collect a tree's nodes as if you were doing this: Collect and remove all leaves, repeat until the tree is empty.**

 

Example:

    Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
      
              1
             / \
            2   3
           / \     
          4   5    
    
    Output: [[4,5,3],[2],[1]]
     

Explanation:

1. Removing the leaves [4,5,3] would result in this tree:

            1
           / 
          2          
 

2. Now removing the leaf [2] would result in this tree:

          1          
 

3. Now removing the leaf [1] would result in the empty tree:

          []
