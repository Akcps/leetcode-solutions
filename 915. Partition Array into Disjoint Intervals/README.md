### 915. Partition Array into Disjoint Intervals

https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-array-into-disjoint-intervals/

Given an array nums, partition it into two (contiguous) subarrays left and right so that:

Every element in left is less than or equal to every element in right.
left and right are non-empty.
left has the smallest possible size.
Return the length of left after such a partitioning.  It is guaranteed that such a partitioning exists.



Example 1:

    Input: nums = [5,0,3,8,6]
    Output: 3
    Explanation: left = [5,0,3], right = [8,6]
Example 2:

    Input: nums = [1,1,1,0,6,12]
    Output: 4
    Explanation: left = [1,1,1,0], right = [6,12]


Note:

    2 <= nums.length <= 30000
    0 <= nums[i] <= 106
    It is guaranteed there is at least one way to partition nums as described.
