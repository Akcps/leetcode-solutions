**311. Sparse Matrix Multiplication**

https://leetcode.com/problems/sparse-matrix-multiplication/

Given two sparse matrices A and B, return the result of AB.

You may assume that A's column number is equal to B's row number.

Example:

    Input:
    
    A = [
      [ 1, 0, 0],
      [-1, 0, 3]
    ]
    
    B = [
      [ 7, 0, 0 ],
      [ 0, 0, 0 ],
      [ 0, 0, 1 ]
    ]
    
    Output:
    
         |  1 0 0 |   | 7 0 0 |   |  7 0 0 |
    AB = | -1 0 3 | x | 0 0 0 | = | -7 0 3 |
                      | 0 0 1 |
