### 115. Distinct Subsequences

https://leetcode.com/problems/distinct-subsequences/

Given two strings s and t, return the number of distinct subsequences of s which equals t.

A string's subsequence is a new string formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the remaining characters' relative positions. (i.e., "ACE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not).

It is guaranteed the answer fits on a 32-bit signed integer.



Example 1:

    Input: s = "rabbbit", t = "rabbit"
    Output: 3
    Explanation:
    As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate "rabbit" from S.
    rabbbit
    rabbbit
    rabbbit
Example 2:

    Input: s = "babgbag", t = "bag"
    Output: 5
    Explanation:
    As shown below, there are 5 ways you can generate "bag" from S.
    babgbag
    babgbag
    babgbag
    babgbag
    babgbag


Constraints:

    1 <= s.length, t.length <= 1000
    s and t consist of English letters.
