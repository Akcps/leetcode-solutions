### 663. Equal Tree Partition

https://leetcode.com/problems/equal-tree-partition/


Given the root of a binary tree, return true if you can partition the tree into two trees with equal sums of values after removing exactly one edge on the original tree.



Example 1:


    Input: root = [5,10,10,null,null,2,3]
    Output: true
Example 2:


    Input: root = [1,2,10,null,null,2,20]
    Output: false
    Explanation: You cannot split the tree into two trees with equal sums after removing exactly one edge on the tree.
    

Constraints:

    The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
    -105 <= Node.val <= 105
