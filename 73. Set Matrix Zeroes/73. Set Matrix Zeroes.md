### 73. Set Matrix Zeroes

https://leetcode.com/problems/set-matrix-zeroes/

Given an m x n integer matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0's, and return the matrix.
You must do it in place.



Example 1:


    Input: matrix = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]
    Output: [[1,0,1],[0,0,0],[1,0,1]]
Example 2:


    Input: matrix = [[0,1,2,0],[3,4,5,2],[1,3,1,5]]
    Output: [[0,0,0,0],[0,4,5,0],[0,3,1,0]]


Constraints:

    m == matrix.length
    n == matrix[0].length
    1 <= m, n <= 200
    -231 <= matrix[i][j] <= 231 - 1


Follow up:

    A straightforward solution using O(mn) space is probably a bad idea.
    A simple improvement uses O(m + n) space, but still not the best solution.
    Could you devise a constant space solution?
