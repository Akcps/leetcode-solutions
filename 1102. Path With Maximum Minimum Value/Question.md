**1102. Path With Maximum Minimum Value**

https://leetcode.com/problems/path-with-maximum-minimum-value/

**Given a matrix of integers A with R rows and C columns, find the maximum score of a path starting at [0,0] and ending at [R-1,C-1].**

**The score of a path is the minimum value in that path.  For example, the value of the path 8 →  4 →  5 →  9 is 4.**

**A path moves some number of times from one visited cell to any neighbouring unvisited cell in one of the 4 cardinal directions (north, east, west, south).**

 

**Example 1:**



Input: [[5,4,5],[1,2,6],[7,4,6]]

Output: 4

Explanation: 

The path with the maximum score is highlighted in yellow. 

**Example 2:**


Input: [[2,2,1,2,2,2],[1,2,2,2,1,2]]

Output: 2

**Example 3:**


Input: [[3,4,6,3,4],[0,2,1,1,7],[8,8,3,2,7],[3,2,4,9,8],[4,1,2,0,0],[4,6,5,4,3]]

Output: 3
 

**Note:**

- 1 <= R, C <= 100
- 0 <= A[i][j] <= 10^9
