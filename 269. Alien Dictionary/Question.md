You receive a list of non-empty words from the dictionary, where words are sorted lexicographically by the rules of this new language. Derive the order of letters in this language.**

Input:
[
  "wrt",
  "wrf",
  "er",
  "ett",
  "rftt"
]

Output: "wertf"

[
  "z",
  "x"
]

**Example 3:**

  "x",
  "z"
]

**Note:**

- You may assume all letters are in lowercase.

- There may be multiple valid order of letters, return any one of them is fine.
