### 653. Two Sum IV - Input is a BST

https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-iv-input-is-a-bst/

Given the root of a Binary Search Tree and a target number k, return true if there exist two elements in the BST such that their sum is equal to the given target.


Example 1:


    Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], k = 9
    Output: true
Example 2:


    Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], k = 28
    Output: false
Example 3:

    Input: root = [2,1,3], k = 4
    Output: true
Example 4:

    Input: root = [2,1,3], k = 1
    Output: false
Example 5:

    Input: root = [2,1,3], k = 3
    Output: true


Constraints:

    The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
    -10 ^ 4 <= Node.val <= 104
    root is guaranteed to be a valid binary search tree.
    -10 ^ 5 <= k <= 105
