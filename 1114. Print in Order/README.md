**1114. Print in Order**

https://leetcode.com/problems/print-in-order/

Suppose we have a class:

    public class Foo {
      public void first() { print("first"); }
      public void second() { print("second"); }
      public void third() { print("third"); }
    }
The same instance of Foo will be passed to three different threads. Thread A will call first(), thread B will call second(), and thread C will call third(). Design a mechanism and modify the program to ensure that second() is executed after first(), and third() is executed after second().

 

**Example 1:**

Input: [1,2,3]

Output: "firstsecondthird"

Explanation: There are three threads being fired asynchronously. The input [1,2,3] means thread A calls first(), thread B calls second(), and thread C calls third(). "firstsecondthird" is the correct output.

**Example 2:**

Input: [1,3,2]

Output: "firstsecondthird"

Explanation: The input [1,3,2] means thread A calls first(), thread B calls third(), and thread C calls second(). "firstsecondthird" is the correct output.
