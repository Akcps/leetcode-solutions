**1115. Print FooBar Alternately**

https://leetcode.com/problems/print-foobar-alternately/

Suppose you are given the following code:

    class FooBar {
      public void foo() {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
          print("foo");
        }
      }
    
      public void bar() {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
          print("bar");
        }
      }
    }
The same instance of FooBar will be passed to two different threads. Thread A will call foo() while thread B will call bar(). Modify the given program to output "foobar" n times.

 

**Example 1:**

Input: n = 1

Output: "foobar"

Explanation: There are two threads being fired asynchronously. One of them calls foo(), while the other calls bar(). "foobar" is being output 1 time.

**Example 2:**

Input: n = 2

Output: "foobarfoobar"

Explanation: "foobar" is being output 2 times.
