A matrix is Toeplitz if every diagonal from top-left to bottom-right has the same element.

Now given an M x N matrix, return True if and only if the matrix is Toeplitz.


Example 1:

Input:

matrix = [
  [1,2,3,4],
  [5,1,2,3],
  [9,5,1,2]
]

Output: True

Explanation:
In the above grid, the diagonals are:
"[9]", "[5, 5]", "[1, 1, 1]", "[2, 2, 2]", "[3, 3]", "[4]".
In each diagonal all elements are the same, so the answer is True.


Example 2:

Input:

matrix = [
  [1,2],
  [2,2]
]
Output: False

Explanation:

The diagonal "[1, 2]" has different elements.


Note:

matrix will be a 2D array of integers.
matrix will have a number of rows and columns in range [1, 20].
matrix[i][j] will be integers in range [0, 99].
