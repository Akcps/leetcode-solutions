**350. Intersection of Two Arrays II**

https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-arrays-ii/

Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.

Example 1:

    Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
    Output: [2,2]
Example 2:

    Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
    Output: [4,9]
Note:

- Each element in the result should appear as many times as it shows in both arrays.
- The result can be in any order.
