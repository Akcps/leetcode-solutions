https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-connect-sticks/

You have some sticks with positive integer lengths.

You can connect any two sticks of lengths X and Y into one stick by paying a cost of X + Y.  You perform this action until there is one stick remaining.

Return the minimum cost of connecting all the given sticks into one stick in this way.

 

Example 1:

    Input: sticks = [2,4,3]
    Output: 14
Example 2:

    Input: sticks = [1,8,3,5]
    Output: 30
 

Constraints:

- 1 <= sticks.length <= 10^4
- 1 <= sticks[i] <= 10^4
