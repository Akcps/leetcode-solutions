**Min Absolute Difference**

Given two sorted arrays A and B, find min difference, one from each array, such that the absolute difference between the two numbers is minimum.

Example 1:

    Input:
    A = [1, 5, 8, 9, 10]
    B = [100, 150, 300]
    
    Output: 90 -> 100 - 10
    
Example 2:
    
    Input:
    A = [ 2, 3 , 6 ,10]
    B = [ 1, 2, 11, 30, 90]
    
    Output: 0 -> 2 - 2
